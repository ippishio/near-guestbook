          This is a redesign of NEAR guest-book, with the implementation of changing wallets 
          and soft designðŸ§¸. 
      </h2> 
      <h4>   Original guest-book is used to demonstrate a key element of NEARâ€™s UX: once an app has
          permission to make calls on behalf of a user (that is, once a user
          signs in), the app can make calls to the blockchain for them without
          prompting extra confirmation. So youâ€™ll see that if you donâ€™t
          include a donation, your message gets posted right to the guest book.
          </h4>

      <h4>
          But if you do add a donation, then NEAR will double-check that
          youâ€™re ok with sending money to this app.
      </h4>
